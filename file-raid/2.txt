Add footnote to explain bad mirrored read/write performance, kind of:

The $1/2$ penalty assumes a naive read/write pattern for mirroring; a more
sophisticated approach that issued large I/O requests to differing parts of
each mirror could potentially achieve full bandwidth. Think about this to see
if you can figure out why.
